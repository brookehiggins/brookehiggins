## Hi, I'm Brooke 👋

Giant bozo with a background in design and a growing love for clean code, clever data, and well-structured chaos.  
Currently studying Applied Math and exploring ways to blend logic, storytelling, and interactive tools.

## 🧩 Projects

### [Drink and Derive](https://brookehiggins.github.io/calculus_game/)
A math trivia game where you get “drunker” every time you mess up.  
Make 5 mistakes and the cops catch you. Don’t drink and derive.  
Built with HTML/CSS/JS, MathJax, and late-night energy.

### [Email Signature Generator](https://brookehiggins.github.io/Gmail-Email-Signature-Generator.io/)
Drag-and-drop email signature builder. Originally built years ago, recently refactored for cleaner UI and more responsive layout.  
Users can update info live and paste the generated preview directly into Gmail. (Outlook… kind of works.)

## 🔭 Currently Exploring
- Front-end dev with a focus on clarity and accessibility  
- Applied math tools + data visualization  
- Building small interactive apps to make learning and life more fun

## 🛠 Tech
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Git / GitHub Pages  
- MathJax, Chart.js
